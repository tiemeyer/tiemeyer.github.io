I don't really know what to write in here, but I need something to work with to set up this blog posts page, so I guess I'm just going to write enough to make sure that the excerpt part of liquid works. Once I get this set up, I can get rid of these three fake posts and Gavin can basically start using the blog as an actual page, which is exciting. I've been working on this page for so long, off and on, but still . . . It'll be nice to have actually finished with it.
