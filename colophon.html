<h3>Colophon</h3>
<p>This site was designed and handwritten by Lucas Smith using Emacs and the Mozilla Firefox suite of developer tools,
  including <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> (an invaluable resource). All content, with the
  exception of this colophon, which was written by the designer, is written by and copyrighted to Gavin Tiemeyer.</p>
<p>The typefaces are part of Cormorant, a free type family made by Christian Thalmann, as found on
  <a href="https://github.com/CatharsisFonts/">Catharsis Fonts</a>. As a typographic reference, Robert Bringhurst's
  <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em> was used, though all faults and discrepancies are the designer's alone.</p>
<p>There is no database, as the site is run with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on
  <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">skeleton.css</a> and <a href="http://jxnblk.com/vhs/">vhs.css</a> were used,
  albeit only very little. I've included both in the css directory for those interested.</p>
<p>Quoting from <a href="https://www.webstandards.org/about/colophon/index.html">The Web Standards Project</a>,
  <blockquote>Note that there is only one version of the site; there are no fancy backend tricks that deliver one site
    to one browser, and another site to another browser. What you get is what everyone gets. It's up to your browser to
    decide what to do with it, which is the way that the Web is supposed to work.</blockquote></p>
