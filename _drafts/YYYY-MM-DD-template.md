### Use this template to make posts
While your posts are in this directory, it isn't necessary for them to include the date;
however, when you decide to publish them, you will need to include the date into the title.
The title should also be completely connected by dashes.

A few basic markdown guidelines:
* to make a list  : start line with asterisk
* to bold text    : ***enclose with three asterisks***
* to italicize    : *enclose with one asterisk*
* to make a link  : [title](https://link.to.page)
* to add an image : ![title](https://link.to.file)
* to quote        : > quote after arrow
* to make header  : ### use three pound signs (or hashtags)

You shouldn't need anything beyond those, but if you do a) ask me, or b) use regular html
(it will work fine). The paragraphs of the post should just be typed as plaintext, such as
how most of this template is. To start a new paragraph, just press enter and start a new line.

Oh, also: a note on headers. I've used to h3 element (###) as the post title, so don't try
to use any other headers or it will look weird. If you need more headers, let me know and
I can add a few more.
